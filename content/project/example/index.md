This study aims to explore the association between voided volume/subjective voided volume (VF/SV) and the symptoms and signs of interstitial cystitis (IC) patients, providing potential new assessment indicators and personalized treatment strategies. By collecting demographic data, clinical information, and voiding diaries of participants, we will evaluate the correlation between VF/SV and subjective symptoms such as pain and urinary frequency, as well as objective indicators such as bladder capacity. The research findings are expected to provide important scientific evidence for the clinical management and research of interstitial cystitis, thereby improving patients' quality of life. This study will be conducted as an observational study, utilizing symptom scales and voiding diaries for data collection, followed by comprehensive analysis. We anticipate that by establishing new assessment indicators, we can more accurately evaluate voiding issues in IC patients, providing scientific basis for clinical assessment and treatment to enhance patients' quality of life.
